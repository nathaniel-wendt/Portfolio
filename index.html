        <article class="bio">
            <p>I’m an Iowa native who moved to Colorado in 2013 after I finally accepted that the Rocky Mountains were never coming to me. When I’m not researching Interaction Design or tinkering with JavaScript there’s a good chance you’ll find me cruising around town on my Road Bike or Sport Climbing up in Boulder Canyon.</p>
            <p>I design and develop professional websites for Artists and Entrepreneurs who are serious about success.</p>
